      Many people got affected by the River Murray flood, these people would have included the Australians living in the area of the flood, and the many people who lost their lives to this horrific flood. Many horrible things happened on this day, many buildings infrastructure, and many people got affected by this flood as they lost their homes and important objects and more in their life, this flood was one of the biggest taking years or more to rebuild all that was lost. In South Australia, near the Victorian Border, this flood affected almost 91,000 hectares. This large flood occurred during the time of 2022-2023, this means this flood happened late last year to early this year, so this flood was not too long ago. As most flood are caused, this flood was caused by very heavy rainfall that was occurring quite a lot and because of this constant rainfall in the Murray-Darling Basin.  <br><br>
