      C. Bird<br>Many people got affected by the River Murray flood, these people would have included the Australians living in the area of the flood, and the many people who lost their lives to this horrific flood. Many horrible things happened on this day, many buildings infrastructure, and many people got affected by this flood as they lost their homes and important objects and more in their life, this flood was one of the biggest taking years or more to rebuild all that was lost. In South Australia, near the Victorian Border, this flood affected almost 91,000 hectares. This large flood occurred during the time of 2022-2023, this means this flood happened late last year to early this year, so this flood was not too long ago. As most flood are caused, this flood was caused by very heavy rainfall that was occurring quite a lot and because of this constant rainfall in the Murray-Darling Basin.  <br><br>
      W. Sturgeon<br> It got up to 21 feet, that's the water level that killed two people and the land got destroyed, and lots of people got their homes destroyed. And had to rebuild the city and get the house back, but there had to wait for the flooding to stop, and the two people.<br><br>
      J. Briggs<br>A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. - Jackie Robinson <br>Whether you reach a lot of people or have a profound impact on a few people, their memories of you are your afterlife. Greg Graffin: Human beings are definitely changing the planet, but how much impact they are having on the climate, I don't know, and I don't care. Felix Dennis <br><br>
      W. Sturgeon<br>The 2022-23 River Murray flood was the largest since 1956 and the third highest on record, caused by persistent heavy rain across the Murray Darling Basin.<br>The 2022-23 Murray River flood in South Australia was caused by heavy interstate rainfall and flood events in other states, leading to the largest flood since 1956 and the third-highest flood on record for South Australia. This event resulted in widespread inundation of approximately 4,000 hectares of agricultural land.<br>Yes, significant disasters and warnings have affected the River Murray, notably the largest flood in almost 70 years in 2022-23, which was the third-highest flood ever recorded in South Australia.<br><br>  
      C. Bird<br>As you can expect, there would have to be many responses and recovery efforts after this flood because it did a lot of damage, there were. There were warnings about this flood, but after this flood occurred, some of the Responses and recovery efforts were the South Australian State Emergency Service helped with Swiftwater rescue.<br>These governments or charities were used to help the people who lost their homes and meaningful objects, or pets to them. Then the charities that helped were the Grenn Industries SA (GISA), another charity that helped a lot was the South Australian State Emergency Service.<br>There were many warnings about this large flood, these warnings could be seen on the Bureau of Meteorology and also the South Australian Emergency Managment Website, so this flood was warned about to many people so they could be prepared.<br><br>
      J. Briggs<br>Following the 2022-2023 River Murray floods, cleanup involves assessing and reopening infrastructure, with specific projects, such as the Twenty-first Street Bridge replacement in the Renmark Paringa Council, to being and reopening infrastructure, with specific projects like the Twentyfirst Street Bridge replacement in the Renmark Paringa Council completed by May 2025. Weather forecasts remain a concern, highlighting the need for efficient water management under the Water for Good plan to meet population needs during drought. Government promises have included the delivery of infrastructure upgrades and support for regional communities, though concerns remain about the long-term impact of climate change on water security and the effectiveness of the Murray-Darling Bain Plan. community’s resilience, ongoing concerns, or hopes for recovery.<br><br>
