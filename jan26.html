    <p>
       With the Murray River floods taking place at the moment, we wanted to look into what’s causing them, so let’s find out! <br><br>With La Niña (which causes the waters of Oceania to be warmer than normal, and frequent rains in NSW and Queensland) occurring, there were multiple floods in the area, flushing gigalitres of water into the Murray River, and causing the largest flooding event since 1956.<br><br>As well as this, a buildup of sediment from historical mining and land clearing, known as the “Sand Slug” acted as a dam, aiding in the river’s overflow. Combined with insufficient infrastructure combatting against the flood, such as levees and floodgates, the battle was over before it even started.<br>Understanding the science behind floods can help communities prepare and adapt.
